There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as "Type 1"(or *bare metal*) and "Type 2"(or *hosted*). A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host's hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.
